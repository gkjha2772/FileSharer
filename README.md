# File Sharing App

A file-sharing application that allows users to upload files to a server, store metadata in MongoDB Atlas, and generate a download link for accessing the uploaded files.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload files to the server.
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration**: File metadata is stored in MongoDB Atlas for easy retrieval.
- **Download Links**: After a file is uploaded, a unique download link is generated.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose (located in the `server` directory)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, dotenv (located in the `client` directory)
- **Storage**: [Specify your storage solution, e.g., AWS S3, local server storage]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- [Any other prerequisites specific to your project]

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   PORT=your_preferred_port
   [Any other environment variables required]
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the following variables if needed:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=your_backend_api_url
   [Any other environment variables required]
   ```

5. **Start the Server:**
